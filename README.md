## Introduction

Have you ever dreamed of building your very own mobile game console? Then this project is for you!

This homemade portable game console is powered by an Arduino Nano, two 8x8 LED dot matrices, a PSP
control stick and two buttons. The system is powered by an external powerbank. All components are
placed inside a custom 3D printed housing. The case was painted with two layers of car paint and
three layers of acrylic paint.

The console features three classic titles: Snake, Space Shooter and Pong. The game library can be
easily expanded.
